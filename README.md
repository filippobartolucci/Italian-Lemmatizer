# Italian Lemmatizer based on Neural Networks

The following project was completed as part of the exam for the Natural Language Processing course at the University of Bologna. The aim of the project
was to tackle the challenge of lemmatisation for the Italian language. We followed
the guidelines of the EVALITA 2011 task and conducted experiments using the
provided dataset. 

# Usage
To run the project, you need run toCSV.py, which will generate the CSV files
needed for the training and testing of the neural network. Then, you can run
notebook.ipynb, which will train the network and test it on the test set.
